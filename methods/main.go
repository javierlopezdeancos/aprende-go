	// A method is nothing but a function, but it belongs to a certain type.
	// A method is defined with slightly different syntax than a normal function.
	// It required an additional parameter known as a receiver which is a type to which the function belongs.
	// This way, a method (function) can access the properties of the receiver it belongs to (like fields of a struct).

	/**********************************/
	/*      Switch to a method        */
	/**********************************/

	// A method can solve this problem easily.
	// To convert a function to the method, we just need an extra receiver parameter in the function definition.
	// The syntax for defining a method is as follows.

	// As a method belongs to a receiver type and it becomes available on that type as a property,
	// we can call that method using Type.methodName(...)syntax. In the above program,
	// we have used e.fullName() to get the full name of an employee since fullName method belongs to Employee.

	// One major difference between functions and methods is we can have multiple methods with same name while no two
	// functions with the same name can be defined in a package.
	// We are allowed to create methods with same name as long as their receivers are different.
	// Letâ€™s create two struct types Circle and Rectangle and create two methods of the same name
	// Area which calculates the area of their receiver.

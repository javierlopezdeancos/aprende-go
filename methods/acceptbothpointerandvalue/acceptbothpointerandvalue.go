package acceptbothpointerandvalue

/**
* When a normal function has a parameter definition, it will only accept the argument of the type
* defined by the parameter. If you passed a pointer to the function which expects a value,
* it will not work. This is also true when function accepts pointer but you are passing a value instead.
* But when it comes to methods, thatâ€™s not a strict rule. We can define a method with value or pointer receiver and
* call it on pointer or value. Go does the job of type conversion behind the scenes
